# Advanced Statistical Physics
My stuff for advanced statistical physics, mostly plots and simulations (written in python).


#### stuff i'm using this for:
- relevant papers
- simulations
- dumb plots

this is really just for me to switch everything around from diff devices and to possibly send the stuff around to other students easily.

#### possible future stuff:
- full solutions to exercises
- lecture transcript

Full solutions only when i have full correct solutions. I don't even know why I would upload that, without the context of the exercises themselves.

The lecture transcript is only mine. I'm reluctant tho, because the prof wants to publish his magnum opus on statistical physics, which is the book to this lecture, possibly later this decade. If i were to publish my notes, part of it would be freely available. so this is unlikely.

#### will never upload:
- official script
- exercises themselves

This is pretty self-explanatory
