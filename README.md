# Advanced Statistical Physics
My stuff for advanced statistical physics, mostly plots and simulations (written in python).


#### stuff i'm using this for:
- relevant papers
- simulations
- dumb plots

this is really just for me to switch everything around from diff devices and to possibly send the stuff around to other students easily.

#### possible future stuff:
- full solutions to problems

I don't even know why I would upload that, without the context of the problems themselves.

#### will never upload:
- official script
- lecture transcript
- problems themselves

The lecture transcript and official script I won't upload, because the prof wants to publish his magnum opus on statistical physics, which is the book to this lecture, possibly later this decade. If i were to publish my notes, part of it would be freely available, so i won't upload my transcript.
