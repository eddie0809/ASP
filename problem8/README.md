### files for problem8, problem sheet4

not too big and difficult of a problem sheet, but there are two plots that are to be done, one of them in problem 8, one of them in problem 9.

if i find time on tuesday i might tex my solutions properly, so that the tutor doesnt have to suffer. whatever, we'll see.
